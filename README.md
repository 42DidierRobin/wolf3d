# 42_WOLF3D
My third graphic project from @42School
For full description please read subject.pdf

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.

Result -> 99/100
